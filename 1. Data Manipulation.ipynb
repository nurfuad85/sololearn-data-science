    "**Data Scientist**  \n",
    "The term “data scientist” was coined as recently as 2008 when companies realized the need for data professionals who are skilled in organizing and analyzing massive amounts of data. In a 2009 McKinsey&Company article, Hal Varian, Google's chief economist and UC Berkeley professor of information sciences, business, and economics, predicted the importance of adapting to technology’s influence and reconfiguration of different industries. “The ability to take data — to be able to understand it, to process it, to extract value from it, to visualize it, to communicate it — that’s going to be a hugely important skill in the next decades.” Hal Varian, chief economist at Google and UC Berkeley professor of information sciences, business, and economics. Effective data scientists are able to identify relevant questions, collect data from a multitude of different data sources, organize the information, translate results into solutions, and communicate their findings in a way that positively affects business decisions\n",

    "There are many use cases in business for data science including finding a better housing price prediction algorithm for Zillow, finding key attributes associated with wine quality, and building a recommendation system to increase the click-through-rate for Amazon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extracting insights from seemingly random data, data science normally involves collecting data, cleaning data, performing exploratory data analysis, building and evaluating machine learning models, and communicating insights to stakeholders.\n",
    "Data science is a multidisciplinary field that unifies statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods to extract knowledge and insights.\n",

    "**Why Python?**  \n",
    "In this Introduction to Data Science course we’re learning data science with Python. As a general-purpose programming language, Python is now the most popular programming language in data science. It’s easy to use, has great community support, and integrates well with other frameworks (e.g., web applications) in an engineering environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course focuses on exploratory data analysis with three fundamental Python libraries: numpy, pandas and matplotlib. The machine learning library scikit-learn will be covered as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the later modules, we will be predicting home values using linear regression, identifying classes of iris with classification algorithms, and finding clusters within wines, just a few examples of what we can do in data science.  \n",
    "In data science, there are other popular programming languages, such as R, which has an edge in statistical modeling."
